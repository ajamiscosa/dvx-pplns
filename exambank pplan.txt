[Logic]
Exam is to be created as is.
Item topic/category after exam is created.
Each question has an edit function in [Review Mode] to be able to create changes if there are any.
[Review Mode] is when you review an item in the exam, and to categorize it.
Category/Topic is assigned to each question in order for it to be reusable.

[tbl_exam] mods
- Exam coordinator / contributor
- Creator can tag other instructors as contributor to the created exam.

~ Field mods
-> Creator 				- ID of Creator
-> Contributors			- ID(s) of contributors. Separated by semicolon.


[Mailer Logic]
On System Generated Messages Regarding Exam Submission.
- Identify subjects that are being handled by 3 or more instructors and recommend as Departmental Exam.
Example:

<Mail Content containing deadline. etc.>

The following subjects are recommended to conduct departmental Examinations:
ELECL1C - General Program Elective 2 w/ Laboratory 1	[ Amiscosa, Cortez, Porto ]
ITFL01G - IT Fundamentals				[ Matel, Peren, Cortez, Aquines ]
ELFRN3C - General Elective 2 (Advanced Web)		[ Amiscosa, Dy, Doctor ]

Should you have any concerns regarding the departmental examinations, please send an email to {{ College::chairperson()->Email }}.
